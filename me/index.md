I am Alex Marshall -- thinker, doer, believer, and I am an aspiring data science specialist. I am endlessly frustrated by promises of the future unmet with realities of the present. I have come to see data scientist as a very useful type of glue that can bring these things together. It drills down onto what actually explains the existance of problems and provides insight into where to focus effort on solving those problems. 

# What do you do?
I have done things in a few different industries/areas. I often think of my life as being divided into the projects that I am currently working on. In high school I built go-karts and competed in science fairs. 

Then in college, I started studying physics as an extension of my interest in science fairs. About the same time, I got interested in FOREX trading, and switch to an Econ/math major. FOREX went about as well as you can expect for first time traders - though I was doing it algorithmically rather than analytically. The idea was that trading on 1m charts 

I kind of got disallusioned with FOREX after that because the intriguing aspect of algorithm trading turned out not work at least in the short term. I actually switched into full mathematical sciences partially because I am interested an enjoy math but also because it seemed like a great fundamental background to build on. 

Quite soon after that, I started working on a startup with college friends 

3d printing - created a blog showing how to make useful 3d printed objects - saw that lacking

snappie! - 

coffee makers

conduce - data munging madness!

We are the generation who needs to start using the computers that our get X'ers built for us, to do cool ass shit!  We don't need to burn out the 

life plan - 25 - 35 get good at data science. Thats a success in my book - take 10 years to get good at something, I hope thats it. girls too


# What do you do for fun?
Ultimate frisbee, soccer, basketball, weightlifting, cooking, skateboarding, snowboarding, machine learning, one piece reading, building espresso machines

# What does your work look like?
I generally like to work with Python. I have done front end/ui stuff, built mobile apps, worked with backends, hardware, firmware, GIS, mapping, data visualization software built and compiled from C files. I feel like I have seen a peek into a large variety of flavors of programming and software construction. The more I look, the more I marvel at its power. It truly is creating order in chaos. You can achieve things that no raw human ever could with the help of a computer. When I enjoy it the most is when this is most apparent, and I think when I am working with python this is most often the case.
