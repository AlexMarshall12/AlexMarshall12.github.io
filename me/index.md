>*Whats a data scientist?* -Alex Marshall

Hi, my name is Alex. Do I love data? Nope. Do I get a kick out of bending, twisting, munging, massaging, and fixing datasets? Nope, but I do it.

Why do I do it? Well it just seems to keep coming up :p. I enjoy problem solving. I find a problem that intrigues me and I want to solve it. I look at the problem and realize its actually a different problem. I look at that problem and what I know. I take what I know and what I can learn through research and the help of others and form a plan. Then all thats left is execution!

This right here is why Im passionate about data science - it is so important! In trying to understand and solve problems, I have repeatedly come across the need to grok the data. It always helps. You are only solving a problem if you really understand it and data science is the way to do so. 

What I have found after going through this process many times is that it really really helps to start on the right path - to know the truth about the problem before you try and solve it. Data science comes in right about here in the problem solving process, and this is why I believe it to be a 

I enjoy seeing new ideas and products solve problems for people. I have come to see data science as an excellent tool in doing this - in forming products and solutions for both consumers and the buinesses that serve them.

# What do you do?
I have been involved in a variety of industries and area of study. I was really focused in physics in high school and the beginning of college and that later became math as my major. Programming is something that I picked up along the way basically because of its power. It was always the fastest and best way to build the solution I had in mind. My thought process is absolutely not limited to a certain industry - i enjoy working on problems in many different areas and this is why my projects are kind of all over the place.
