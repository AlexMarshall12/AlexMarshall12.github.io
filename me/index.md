Hi, my name is Alex. 

I enjoy problem solving. I find a problem that intrigues me and I want to solve it. I look at the problem and realize its actually a different problem. I look at that problem and what I know. I take what I know and what I can learn through research and the help of others and form a plan. Then all thats left is execution!

I enjoy seeing new ideas and products solve problems for people. I have come to see data science as an excellent tool in doing this - in forming products and solutions for both consumers and the buinesses that serve them.

# What do you do?
I have been involved in a variety of industries and area of study. I was really focused in physics in high school and the beginning of college and that later became math as my major. My thought process is absolutely not limited to a certain industry - i enjoy working on problems in many different areas and this is why my projects are kind of all over the place.   

# What do you do for fun?
Ultimate frisbee, soccer, basketball, weightlifting, cooking, skateboarding, snowboarding, machine learning, one piece reading, building espresso machines

# What do you look like?
Who me??
