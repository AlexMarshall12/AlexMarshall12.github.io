Hi, my name is Alex.


I enjoy seeing new ideas and products solve problems for people. I have come to see data science as an excellent tool in doing this - in forming products and solutions for both consumers and the buinesses that serve them. 

# What do you do?
I have been involved in a variety of industries and area of study. I was really focused in physics in high school and the beginning of college and that later became math as my major. I started doing a lot of programming out of necessity to build the things I wanted to build. Its useful stuff! Now I work as a developer for a company named Conduce that makes Data Visualization software for operational logistics. My thought process is absolutely not limited to a certain industry - i enjoy working on problems in many different areas and this is why my projects are kind of all over the place.   

# What do you do for fun?
Ultimate frisbee, soccer, basketball, weightlifting, cooking, skateboarding, snowboarding, machine learning, one piece reading, building espresso machines

# What do you look like?
Who me??
