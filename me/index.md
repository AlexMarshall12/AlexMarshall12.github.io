Hi, my name is Alex.

I enjoy seeing new ideas and products solve problems for people. I believe that the best products and services are those that simplify our lives and society. To get to the root or core of an issue or desire is incredibly valuable. Complexity is entropy and we must continually work against it.

I am interested in range of industries, including energy production, transportation, water management, home appliances, and software tools and services. 

I graduated from college in 2012 and have been working as a software developer in Santa Barbara, CA. Most recently, I have been working at a data visualization company named Conduce.

In my free time, I enjoy a number of sports - running, ultimate frisbee, soccer, basketball, weightlifting, snowboarding, as well as spending time in nature, traveling, cooking, hacking or prototyping, machine learning projects, one piece reading, building espresso machines...
