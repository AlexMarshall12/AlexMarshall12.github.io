I am Alex Marshall -- thinker, doer, believer, and an aspiring data science specialist. I enjoy seeing new ideas and products solve problems for people. I have come to see data science as an excellent tool in doing this - in forming products and solutions for both consumers and the buinesses that serve them.

# What do you do?
I have been involved in a variety of industries and area of study. I was really focused in physics in high school and the beginning of college and that became math later as my major. Programming is something that I picked up along the way basically because of its power. It was always the fastest and best way to build the solution I had in mind. My thought process is absolutely not limited to a certain industry - i enjoy working on problems in many different areas and this is why my projects are kind of all over the place.
