title: The app system is outdated
category: opinion

The app system was revolutionary. Every function is so compartmentalized - so easy to understand, to pick and choose. But is it best?

Phones are still used to communicate. Now instead of communicating with just people. we communicate with services and servers as well. When you order an Uber, you are basically asking uber for a ride. Why is there an app for this? You should be able to text uber and say give me a ride and there she is. 

Have you noticed that the most popular apps are all about chatting? Snapchat, Wechat, Whatsapp, Line, facebook messenger. 

Honnestly its divided into two categories, chats and feeds. ugh and forums fine. 

But a lot of shit does not have to be an app. App interfaces are shittier than chat as a general rule. What if a phone instead was a box with just a list of contacts and 1 was uber and 1 was snapchat.

Hardware app store?
