Why are Games gonna be so useful in the future. 

Assume a future full of AI/automation and basic income. 

People won't have nothin to do :(

2 things will help - education and purpose

education to help people towards more useful goals. purpose can come from Games. In fact, you could kill 2 birds with 1 stone. 

What will truck drivers and cashiers do in the future - they will need to learn something new and have a purpose. 

what should they be doing with their time? Art? Science? Math? yep - intellectual pursuits. Smash tourneys?

Games like escape room are just terrific imo - you work together to solve a common goal or problem. If they could have real purpose, show you something worthwhile, and at the same time, provide education, it would be so terrific. 3 birds with 1 stone. 

Activities like escape room are gonna become more and more common - entertainment in new and interesting ways..... we need something other than bars - not that bars aren't fun ofc. 

But yeah cool shit to do with your friends thats entertaining, educational, and fun. Football, sports, games, etc. WE NEED MORE! It would also solve social issues for many people/introverts. People who don't wanna just drink/work all the time. 

Other ideas: Non-virtual games, games that use your world.
