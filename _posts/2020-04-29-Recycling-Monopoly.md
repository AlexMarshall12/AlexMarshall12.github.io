I wonder if its possible to create a monopoly with Recycling materials and creating new products out of them. You would replicate the vertical integration of Standard Oil. You would go to people's houses, pick up their recycling - maybe paying them for it? Take it to your plant, reduce it to raw materials, and create new products out of it. In this way you would control the entire pipeline of these natural materials more or less. 

Right now the process seems quite... chaotic. Recycled materials aren't used basically, they end up in a landfill or some shipping port. New materials are mined by mining companies, these materials are sold to chemical people. Chemical engineers create source materials out of raw stuff, they sell it to factories, factories produce the product for companies which market it and sell them to consumers. This is a perfect example of capitalism at work - but is all the value competed away?(peter theil) The alternative would be total vertical integration. Forks and Spoons created out of recycled materials for instance. All from recycling to product again.
