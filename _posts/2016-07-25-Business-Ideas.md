Problem is interference with other ocean going vessels..?  Huge importance, necessity, and opportunity because of the pacific ocean garbage patch as well as the japan earthquake debris (supposed to be a huge problem in the next 1 - 3 years)  High potential for grants, donations, and overall support because of the importance and good intentions of the project.
