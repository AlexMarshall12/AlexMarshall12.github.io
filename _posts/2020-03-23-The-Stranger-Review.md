I just finished this book this morning. I read all of the reviews about existentialism and absurdism which make me like it even more. I thought one thing was how lovable Messault was. Him exploring his feelings and his inability to express them made me sad for him. Especially in the courtroom where everyone was being so obnoxious I wished that he could convey to them what he was to us. This is not to say that I don't think he's guilty. I certainely do. But his feelings and reactions are valid and it would be worth the courts attention to more deeply understand his experience. 

I thought it was sad yet thought provoking how much time he spent waiting around doing nothing and how this seemed to be his happiest state - almost as if he was waiting for the universe to give him inspiration to finally make him feel something - his ultimate quest and one that not even murder could satiate - until finally in the end the imminence of his death brings him relief. I appreciated this because I feel like this often. And the lesson that the end of the book teaches is one that I can learn from. That the universe will never do this, it is empty and judgeless. It is you that must find passion in your own actions and desires that you create. And this is what he learns in the end too and he realizes how Maman must have felt before her passing.
