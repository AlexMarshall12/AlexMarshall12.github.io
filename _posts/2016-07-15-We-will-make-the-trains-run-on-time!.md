Whether or not Mussolini actually said this is not terribly relevant. In fact, the fact that he didn't specifically say this, but that history latched on to it anyways -after reframing it, makes it all the more powerful. We want to hear shit like this. Its outrageous, evocative, intoxicating and alluring. Its exactly what someone trying to win our hearts should be saying. 

Why? Because its simple, and its the core most direct example of Vision. Vision thats not all mixed up with a multi-step plan, not totally unrelistic, pie in the sky type of nonsense, and is a real issue that we all care about. Is it actually harder than it sounds? Probably. But in an election or any complex set of events, people rejoyce when simplicity rises. Good or bad the other candidates or choices may be, at least this guys gonna do one thing that I can agree with. 

Its crazy to me how this sounds so simple yet people still get this wrong. Vision has been conflated with hype happy CEOs that make headlines but no actual products or real solutions - often those slimy money hungry silicon valley types. Its become such an groan-inducing word in fact that me writing this very post seems redundant and cheesy. 

However, I am writing this because I realize how rare it STILL is! Companies are created because the founders see a product which could make money if circumstances went right. Then somewhere along they line they throw a vision statement into the pitch deck - often one that is bended a bit to fit where the company is already going. Even worse its sometimes a multi-step vision statement - 3 golden rules or even 10 steps we live by. Is this "We will make the trains run on time!" Hell no! 

Visions don't need to be grand, but they sure can be. So why isn't an achievable sounding vision like "we will bring the real estate management industry into the 21rst century!" ever loved, but groaned at instead? Its not because its too hard or too easy. Its because 


1. No one cares about it. Seriously. Explain how 21rst century real estate software in management firms matters to anyone. It could possibly matter to the workers at the managment offices but if they cared that much, they would fix it themselves. 
2. Its not the true vision!



The true vision was that the founders got together and saw a business opportunity in selling updated management software to real estate management firms. Such companies have a yearly budget for software that they need to fill and the SAAS business model here is ripe for the picking - repeat contracts till the end of time! Why in the world is this a bad thing? Its not. This is your vision statement. Say it, don't form a company and then ponder how to word a vision statement about bringing the real estate industry forward. Say what you mean! We are capitalizing on this business opportunity to make a hell of a lot of money for us and our investors. At least everyone is on the same page, and man is it great when everyone is on the same page. 

That way it doesn't confuse your young intern who creates a real estate app to submit issues to managment company X and you guys shut down the project because it won't make money. Point him to the wall where it details your true vision statement. And he'll be grateful that you are being straightforward with him. Nothing wrong with $$$ .

So "Make the trains run on time!" has been done, but honestly if you started a company with that as a vision, I bet you'd do pretty darn well. People still hate late trains. Just make sure you are honest about wtf you are doing there.
