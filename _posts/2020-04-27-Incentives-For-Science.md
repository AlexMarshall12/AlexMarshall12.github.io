Ive been thinking a lot why Physics for instance, which provides such high levels of value for society, captures none of the value it creates. Scientists get famously paid very little. Academia has become very buearucratic because there is so little value to go around. Then it produces very little value. Is it all coasting on the clout of the university? The university is getting money so why change anthing. Why do professors put out research. 

I think its a smaller part of a big problem. Tech companies for instance, capture a larger percentage of the value they create. I think this is because all value creation is bottle-necked by the spending power of the consumer. Because people don't have money to spend, they can't buy apps for instance. Then tech companies make money through advertising - they have found the only possible way left to capture value - the scale. 

Science, Biology for instance, is not so lucky. Say there was a cure for alzheimers. It would provide value for many many people. However, those people can each pay very little. There is a tenous link between their hospital bill and the scientist who created the cure. Thus there is little incentive for people to go into science. 

Its like advertising is the one bridge - the magic key. Corporate spending is the other - B2B is famously easier to create than B2C. Why can't there be a direct line between the science that gets done, and the value it creates. Then the people who are benefiting from it could pay the scientists and the field would open back up into a healthy one. Sales cures all and science/academia have not had any sales ever in a long time. 

Its playcated by the idea that because this stuff is SO important, you can't charge anything for it. It needs to be released for the good of the world - anything else is just greedy. Like open source. However this doesn't work. For profit science. Is that a thing? How could we make it one. Would that help scientific stagnation?

Why dont' scientist make more money ?

The common reasons are: 

1. Their research does not have immediate benefit to society. They aren't doing it to make a product or service, and thus even if its valuable, it doesn't make money. There is no money to be had!
2. Scientists don't care about money. They do it for the love of the research. Thus they don't seek out money. 
3. Supply and demand - there is a surplus of people willing to do science. Thus there isn't much demand. Thus they don't get paid much. Its just so fun and fufilling and rewarding. 

I think many of these are true, however, I still think we need more scientists and need science to be more incentivized because of reasons x,y,z. I think the core reason this can't happen is that even though abstract work provides huge value to society, none of that value is captured. For instance, perhaps Maxwell's children should be getting royalty checks to this day for his discovery of electromagnetisism. I can see the scorn from here but imagine what it might do for our society if parents wanted their kids to become scientists instead of doctors or lawyers.
