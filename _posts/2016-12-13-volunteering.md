title: Bar on service providing/volunteering

my family was interested in volunteering for Christmas this year 
instead of the entire x-mas thing
however, apparently any volunteering you can do on xmas is booked from like June/July onwards
people love volunteering at xmas
and apparently volunteers are not that needed
it was like that when there was an oil spill in sb
people kept showing up at the beach and there was an entire team in charge of informing them that they could not volunteer, that they would be doing more harm than good
I have heard a similar thing when people are giving blood
generally the demand is << supply
It makes me wonder because there are still all these problems 
yet helping doesn't seem to help anymore 
at least your helping needs to be way more out of the box than it used to 
like you can no longer just be "of service"
you have to actively and creatively problem solve in order to do something as simple as help solve a problem
like the bar has been raised on that too, just like its being raised on what it takes to get a job
weird
