As of late, I've been thinking a bit about the future. Dangerous, fool-hardy, impure almost but hey I can't help it. The more I learn about myself the more I realize I just am not as perfect of a person as it might be convinient for me to be...

I have an ego, I need to be doing something "great". Is it enough to live a simple life? Yes but it must also be important - simplicity is important and the most simple of lives are often those which are the most powerful and have the greatest impact. If you spend all your time and effort trying to get to mars, thats a simple life in a way... *cough elon

So there are several areas that are burgeoning in the future.. I will be evaluating them one by one, sharing my thoughts, and considering the value of me trying to get a job in that industry. Is this the healthiest way to choose a career? Nope - see above.

Elon musk (Im a huge fan of his btw, anothe post on him probably incoming...) says there are 5 areas which are going to be big in the future

1. space
2. renewable energy
3. AI
4. The internet
5. genetics/bioengineering

Of course he may be wrong, but these areas are so broad they can start as talking points - with a bit of adjustment.

## Space ##

Not much we can do here.... I am interested in this, especially after reading a bit more about the fermi paradox on waitbutwhy and the elon musk superseries. Also, since the historic spaceX presentation at the 2016 IAC. This is intriguing, but seeing as I have no engineering background, I think its probably best to sit the actual transportation out and focus on what can be done after we get to mars....

## Renewable Energy ##

This is probably the most intriguing to me. I sometimes wonder why... I think it might go back to simplicity. Insofaras the goal of a society is to facilitate the livelihood of the people living in it, the fact that adding more people to the system causing collapse is not a great design. Its not beautiful design - it also kind of leads me to the fact that humans are not a "good" thing. That there are certain of us that are opposite from me and theres nothing I can do about it. This doesn't sit with me. I would love for our system to work... For adding more people to not strain everyone... is this possible? A huge step in the right direction is sustainable energy. Its just such a satisfying idea. If every business and measure of productivity and growth and prosperity can be reduced to energy availablility, the idea of sustainable, non harmful energy seems to be such a huge leap in the right direction...

Is it about "saving" the world, saving all those people you don't really know? No, its more about the idea of coming to peace with humanity - knowing that it can co-exist as a good pure thing and something that I can identify with. This is a powerful good idea.

HOWEVER, this space is frustrating to me. And this is why - innovation has basically never been performed in the energy industry. Enegy is a commodity. The amount of energy supplied and demanded will not change if things get more renewable. Thus the incentive to do a really good job with solar is there but the return won't be.

## AI ##

This is transformative, but how much? Chat bots are going to be huge. Voice interface with a system would be hugely valueable...

in fact lets start a list:

1. a cafe where you can just sit down and talk to a chatbot to order. a restaurant which does this.
2. purchasing crssd tickets on craigslist. Hey chatbot, get me a ticket for < 140. Make sure its not a scammer, and that they accept venmo. thanks :PPPPPPP
3. find me cool shit to do in my area




eh fuck chatbots

Whats wrong with the world?


People are too isolationist. There is always a manner of protection. I need to protect my resources, my stuff, from others that must be trying to take it away, so that I can live the life I want to live.

Dare to dream hmm?



A story with characters based on:

1. luffy
2. michael jordan
3. zyzz
4. torstein horgmo
5. mango
6. homer simpson
7. will ferrell
8. tim and eric
9. elon musk



What is the story of our age? In fantasy form? Is it good vs evil? Is it one piece? I believe its one of discovery - of suddenly being connected to every other human and ecosystem on earth and seeing its similarities and differences. This brings about tension - because people on the other side of the world are more similar to you than you though. It is reassuring because you can get to know them, however you realize that the same problems that exist in one area exist in others - you realized you can't get away from them by hiding out?


Maybe the moral of the story could be about isolationism vs outreach. What is the "heros journey" in this case?

shitttt do people need to be more connected?

people really need to get out there and try new shit and
