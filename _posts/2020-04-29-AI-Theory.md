I have a theory concerning AI. Many of the things that AI cannot do, and the things that are the most valuable, are within the context of the human experience. Someone says "what are you thinking". AI says "what am I thinking about what". If this was asked to a human, the human would undertand the context of the conversation, all the players involved, have experience with outcomes from similar instances in the past, etc. All of these things come from our experience being human and living in our world - talking to humans and learning colloquialisms and slang and memes and interpreting cultural differences, etc. 

Of course this is classically hard. However, since we are experiencing our world 24/7, the AI would have to experience the world 24/7 just to match us, let alone keep up. To exceed this would be to experience things faster which I think may be impossible - of course you can read books quickly but to get as much out of them simply takes the second to follow the thought through. 

I basically don't think that any AI will ever be able to match a human in becoming "relatable" which is what all people want their AI's to do anyways, unless the AI literally lives lifetimes in our world, in which case it wouldn't even be useful and it would have no time for computation, let be willing to help us out. Think about music - the best music is created by humans who have undergone a very commonly relatable experience or emotion and they sing about it in a way that teaches us about the experience - that we are not alone in how we feel about it. They pour time and effort into detailing how they feel about this, employing skill of course, but mostly the seed of the creativity is the experience. How can AI possibly match that if it doesn't share the same experience we do.
