I've recently had to deal with a salvage title car - finding a way to get rid of it, and getting a new car in a financially sensible way. This has been an interesting and eye opening experience.

For instance, I tend to think with a hacker mindset - if a car works, and its safe, you should be able to drive it. This is not the case. The auto industry has a very specific pipeline for cars to live through and if you don't adhere to this, there are many ways in which you get screwed over.


OK so the total lifecycle of my subaru:

1. got in an accident. Was front-ended at 2 mph. Slight damage to the front grill and headlight.
2. car was declared salvage, I have to kill my car basically to remain in the pipeline and make financially beneficial decisions. The insurance company pays way too much for the car - my declared value.
3. I can no longer register my car. I have to "revive" it. This is tempting. I mean its only slightly dented for crying out loud!
4. I drive with no registration for a while because I realize it makes no sense to revive this car. Even if I do, I can't sell it as it will be a "rebuilt" title and the salvage will still be on the record. Not only does this make the resale value lower, but whoever buys it will have trouble insuring it. And even if they do insure it, they will be able to pay full price each month but say they get into a fender bender of their own. Insurance will see it and see that its already salvage. They will not pay to repair it and an also not pay to declare it salvage so you are SOL. Basically the system is telling you you shouldn't be driving salvage title cars.
5. I get pulled over > 6 months after it is declared un-registerable. It has to be towed. Now I am iced because its going to impound. I don't want the car so its tempting to just hand it over to the impound lot. I also can't get it re-registered to drive it away. However the impound lot really is trying to get my car for free - they don't really negotiate. So on the way to the impound lot I decided to go to the dmv instead and get a moving permit to at least take the car away - partially so that I have the satisfaction of not giving the impound lot anything more than I have to.
