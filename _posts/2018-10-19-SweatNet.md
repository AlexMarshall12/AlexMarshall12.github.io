This is an app I made to help people track workout progress photos and videos. When you are really trying to get better at a physical skill, pose, or exercise such as a handstand, l-sit, downward-dog, squat, etc it is really useful to take progress pictures or videos so that you can compare them and see how much progress you've made. Right now this is basically done in your phone's default photo library, or at least it was for me.

I was frustrated originally because these photos/videos kept crowding my photos library which is a bit weird and inconvenient when sharing photos with someone who is scrolling through your library. I mean they should really just be organized in a separate app right? They aren't really photos for a photos sake, they are a different thing.

So I decided to try and build something almost exactly like the photos library as a starting point, then improve from there. This is my second app so I am certainly learning as I go.
