Business becomes lame when it makes things less efficient. One example is when a company tries to overproduce a youtube video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFUIVRLXD68 Say this youtube video shows a cat purring at the loudest world record breaking amount of decibles ever recorded for a specific cat.

People clearly want to see only the cat purring. The company however tries to doctor up the video so that it has more advertising revenue, content generation, can employ more people.

This is making the delivery mechanism worse. The worst part is, the company knows that it isn't providing more value for the end user by doing this. Instead they know that infefficiencies in advertising companies allow ad newtorks to pay them $ for the video, all while promising increased sales to their clients despite both parties knowing that people watching a cat purr won't be interested in buying anything else referred by the video. However, they rely on the fact that advertising is an inexact science and that poor click conversions can be forgiven even though they know damn well why its not working.

Why is this immoral? It reduces the value provided to two parties - the end user, and the client of the advertsing company, while paying $ to the ad network and the producers of the video.

Thus I blame these two parties which are the ones who know its happening. It is immoral becase you are providing a reduced value for the same price, all while knowing exactly why this is happening, yet feigning ignorance. Its almost a scam.

Now, what value are they actually providing? Lots. The video production company takes the time to go out to the house, video tape the world record, edit it, post it on youtube, deal with ad-networks. You can charge for that. Perhaps they aren't charging enough. If this isn't enough to make it financially sensible for the video production company, they should adjust prices, not add additional crap that no one wants or cares about.
