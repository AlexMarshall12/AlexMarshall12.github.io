Every few months I write about how the future will go. What will the world look like 200 years from now?

Sleep will remain about the same. I will wake up in a bed with a perfect matress, a perfect temperature, perhaps suspended in water. 

Breakfast is of course made for me, despite what my socio-economic status is. Its probably the same thing. Pretty much food from anywhere around the world. Food storage and availability is prevalent. Food waste is not an issue as it gets recycled into the earth.
